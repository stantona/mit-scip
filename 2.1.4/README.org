*** Exercise 2.14
** Lem is right.
   - (For high tolerances)
   - (define resistor1 (make-interval 2.3 2.4))
   - (define resistor2 (make-interval 5.0 5.4))
   - (par1 resistor1 resistor2)
     (1.4743589743589742 . 1.7753424657534247)
   - (par2 resistor1 resistor2)
     (1.5753424657534243 . 1.6615384615384614
   - A pretty substantial difference.
** Computing the expression A/A
   (div-interval int int)
   (.98989898989899 . 1.010204081632653)
   - When dividing an interval with itself, it should result in an interval with a lower and upper bounds equal to 1.
   - The values that are calculated are close to one (with small percentage tolerances from the center). I'm sure this
     is because of floating point number inexactness.
** Computing the expression A/B
** Examples of inexact calculations
   (- 3.25 3.2) => .04999999999999982
