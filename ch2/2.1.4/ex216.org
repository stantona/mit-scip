** Why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different answers?

Arithmetic affects intervals differently. Not only does the center change, but the boundaries also change.
For division, the uncertainty ratio for two intervals are added to each other creating more uncertainty. So therefore
two variables are affected; the center value and the uncertainty ratio (or lower and upper bounds). 

The parallel resistor expressions, although equivalent produce different answers because each arithmetic operatoin adds
to the uncertainty. Therefore depending on the operations performed, you will get different results although they are 
algebraically equivalent.

I can't say that the task for catering for this problem is impossible but given the system of arithmetic defined in the 
text I'd say it is. Unless there is a way providing a different representation for the data that works.
